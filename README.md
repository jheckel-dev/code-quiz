coding bootcamp homework 4, coding quiz

Very challenging assignment, had to pull form countless sources more than usual to get things to work together and had to scratch the project 2-3 times.

Decided the best course was to use two HTML files and Two Scripts.

one index to start the quiz, a script to run the quiz in the index

one HTML for the highscores that is linked to the index, a script that runs in the HTML to store scores locally

upon opening index, user is is given a link to view locally saved high scores, is given a button to start the quiz.

upon completing the quiz or running out of time user is prompted to enter their initials to store their score locally

files should include the following:
    index.html
    highscore.html
    questions.js
    highscores.js
    style.css

work to still be done:
    get input box to give an alert upon not entering initiails
    highscores button and back buttons are too snug on each other, does not look as clean as it sould.
